# TODO
List of things to add to this project

## Crucial
* Handle all the w.Write errors somehow
* Add export feature
* Add missing frontend pages

## Long-medium term considerations
* Improve logging, log to files
* Make the CLI better
* Think about timezones
* Consider more secure auth methods
* *Go* dependency-less? <-- this is a terrible idea
