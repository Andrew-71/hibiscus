List of things to add to this project

* Make scram configurable
* Use reflection in config loading
* Check export function for improvements
* Improve viewing of data (textarea over raw API requests)
* More slog.Debug and a debug flag?
* Think about timezones
* Consider more secure auth methods
* *Go* dependency-less? <-- this is a terrible idea
