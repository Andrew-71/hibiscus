# TODO
List of things to add to this project

## Agenda
* a 512x logo so I can enable PWA
* CI/CD pipeline
* Better docs in case others want to use this for some reason
* Check export function for improvements

## Brainstorming
Don't expect any of this, these are ideas floating inside my head
* Further info page functionality
  * Edit config
  * Statistics e.g. mb taken, number of day pages/notes
* Multi-user support through several username-pass keys
  * `/data/<user>/...`
  * This would be an *extremely* breaking change
  * How to handle exporting *all*? Admin account?
  * I don't need this, unless Hibiscus.txt somehow gets popular why bother? 
  Is this even a feature that fits the vision?
* *Go* dependency-less? <-- this is a terrible idea
