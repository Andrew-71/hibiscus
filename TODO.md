# TODO
List of things to add to this project

* Forward/backward buttons for days

## v1.0.0
* a logo so I can enable PWA (and look cool)
* Versioned containers via `ghcr.io` or `dockerhub`, 
with automatic CI/CD build on release
* ...QA? And polishing.

## Brainstorming
Don't expect any of this, these are ideas floating inside my head
* Further info page functionality
  * Statistics e.g. mb taken, number of day pages/notes
  * Test telegram link
* Multi-user support through several username-pass keys
  * `/data/<user>/...`
  * This would be an *extremely* breaking change
  * How to handle exporting *all*? Admin account?
  * I don't need this, unless Hibiscus.txt somehow gets popular why bother? 
  Is this even a feature that fits the vision?
* Better, *multi-page* docs in case others want to use this for some reason
* Check export function for improvements
* *Go* dependency-less? <-- this is a terrible idea
