# ðŸŒº Hibiscus.txt

Simple plaintext diary.

This project is *very* highly opinionated and minimal.

## Features:
* Each day, you get a txt file. You have until 23:59 of that very day to finalise it.
* At any moment, you can log a single line to the log file
* You can save named notes to document milestones, big events, or just a nice game you played this month
* You can export everything in a zip file. Emergency export code for other people will be supported

* No extra features. No encryption, OAuth, or anything fancy. Even the password is plain te- wait is this a feature?
* Intention to eventually *Go* dependency-less (get it?). Sorry chi, I still like you!
