# ðŸŒº Hibiscus.txt

Simple plaintext diary.

This project is *very* opinionated and minimal. It is designed primarily for myself.

## Features:
* Each day, you get a txt file. You have until 23:59 of that very day to finalise it.
* At any moment, you can log a single line to the log
* You can save named notes to document milestones, big events, or just a nice game you played this month
* You can easily export everything in a zip file for backups

* Everything is in plain text. No databases, encryption, OAuth, or anything fancy. Even the password is plain te- wait is this a feature?
