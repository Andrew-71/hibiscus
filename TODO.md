# TODO
List of things to add to this project

* CI/CD pipeline
* Better docs in case others want to use ths for some reason
* PWA support? I heard it's like installing websites as apps, could be useful!
* GitHub/Codeberg/whatever mirror for when `faye` (my server) is offline
* Check export function for improvements
* *Go* dependency-less? <-- this is a terrible idea
