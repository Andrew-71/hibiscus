# TODO
List of things to add to this project

* Better docs in case others want to use ths for some reason
* Github/Codeberg/whatever mirror for when `faye` (my server) is offline
* Improve config and use reflection when loading it
* Do to other methods what was done to GetDays/GetNotes?
* API revamp
* Check export function for improvements
* Add note creation and deletion to frontend (*properly*)
* Customise log file
* More slog.Debug and a debug flag?
* Consider less clunky auth method
* *Go* dependency-less? <-- this is a terrible idea
